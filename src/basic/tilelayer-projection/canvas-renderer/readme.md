TileLayer has 2 renderers: `canvas` and `gl`(default). When browser doesn't support webgl(IE9/10), it will switch to `canvas` automatically.

The differences between them are:

| renderer | IE9/10 | 3D | [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) required |
| ------| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| gl | NO | YES | YES |
| canvas | YES | NO | NO* |


\* When exporting map's image by calling map.toDataURL, CORS is required and  TileLayer must set crossOrigin in options.
