[Proj4js](http://proj4js.org) is a JavaScript library to transform point coordinates from one coordinate system to another, including datum transformations.

Maptalks can work with proj4js to load maps or data from different geo projections.

All you need to do is to define a projection object with proj4js and set to map's spatial reference.

Below is a proj4js version of the default EPSG:3857 projection.
